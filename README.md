## Original Readme:

Adds object graphics events for all Pokemon up to generation 7.
https://github.com/ghoulslash/pokeemerald/tree/overworld-expansion

Uses the overworld expansion for 16bit ids:
merge/overworld-expansion

## How to use

All Pokemon overworld sprites are disabled by default to avoid blowing the ROM size out the window.

To enable specific species (or all of them), uncomment their respective lines in the following files.
First entry in each file is included for searching:

1. **src/data/object_events/object_event_graphics_info_pointers.h**
    ```c
    extern const struct ObjectEventGraphicsInfo gObjectEventGraphicsInfo_Pokemon_Species_001;
    ```
    ```c
    [OBJ_EVENT_GFX_POKEMON_001] = 	&gObjectEventGraphicsInfo_Pokemon_Species_001,
    ```

2. **src/data/object_events/object_event_graphics_info.h**
    ```c
    const struct ObjectEventGraphicsInfo gObjectEventGraphicsInfo_Pokemon_Species_001 = { 0xFFFF, OBJ_EVENT_PAL_TAG_POKEMON_001, OBJ_EVENT_PAL_TAG_NONE, 512, 32, 32, 0, SHADOW_SIZE_M, FALSE, FALSE, TRACKS_FOOT, &gObjectEventBaseOam_32x32, sOamTables_32x32, sAnimTable_PokemonSpecies, gObjectEventPicTable_Pokemon_Species_001, gDummySpriteAffineAnimTable};
    ```

3. **src/data/object_events/object_event_graphics.h**
    ```c
    const u32 gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001[] = INCBIN_U32("graphics/object_events/pics/pokemon/species/001.4bpp");
    const u16 gObjectEventPalette_Pokemon_Species_001[] = INCBIN_U16("graphics/object_events/pics/pokemon/species/001.gbapal");
    ```

4. **src/data/object_events/object_event_pic_tables.h**
    ```c
    const struct SpriteFrameImage gObjectEventPicTable_Pokemon_Species_001[] = {
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 0),
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 1),
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 2),
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 3),
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 4),
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 5),
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 6),
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 7),
        overworld_frame(gObjectEventPic_Pokemon_Species_001, 4, 4, 8),
    };
    ```

5. **src/event_object_movement.c**
    ```c
    {gObjectEventPalette_Pokemon_Species_001, OBJ_EVENT_PAL_TAG_POKEMON_001},
    ```

6. **spritesheet_rules.mk**
    ```mk
    $(OBJEVENTGFXDIR)/pokemon/species/001.4bpp: %.4bpp: %.png
        $(GFX) $< $@ -mwidth 4 -mheight 4
    ```

## Other notes

In **include/constants/event_objects.h** the define for the object event remains visible.
This means that Porymap will see it by default, but cannot access its graphics, and the game will not recognise it.
```c
#define OBJ_EVENT_GFX_POKEMON_001		(NUM_REGULAR_OBJ_EVENT_GFX + 0)
```

The same holds true for the palette tag entries in **src/event_object_movement.c**
```c
#define OBJ_EVENT_PAL_TAG_POKEMON_001 (OBJ_EVENT_PAL_TAG_POKEMON_START  + 1)
```

## Adding new entries

Just simply include a similar item for each of these files mentioned above. Listed below for reference:

- include/constants/event_objects.h
- src/data/object_events/object_event_graphics_info_pointers.h
- src/data/object_events/object_event_graphics_info.h
- src/data/object_events/object_event_graphics.h
- src/data/object_events/object_event_pic_tables.h
- src/event_object_movement.c
- spritesheet_rules.mk

You can always do a search for `_69` for example to find places that `OBJ_EVENT_GFX_POKEMON_069` or `gObjectEventPicTable_Pokemon_Species_069` are used etc.

Make sure to include the 4bpp indexed png graphics in **graphics/object_events/pics/pokemon/species**
